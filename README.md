# Snoot-Base-YSD3-Locline
Snoot base for Sea and Sea YS-D3 Loc Line snoot, requires drilling and tapping
To finish the the snoot base you will need a 1/2 inch npt tap and an 8-32 tap to thread the holes. These can be obtained pretty inexpensively. You will need to acquire three 8-32 
marine appropriate bolts. I like the knurled nylon ones from Mcmaster-Carr personally that are ~12 mm long.
